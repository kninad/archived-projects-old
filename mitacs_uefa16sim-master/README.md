## Mitacs Euro 2016 simulation

R code files for the Uefa Euro 16 simulations. 

Project carried out in summer 2016. 

It was an additional side project along with my Mitacs Globalink research internship in Canada. 

The reports for the simulation and the graph sampling analysis are available in the repository root (as pdf files).
